## [Different ways to execute Flux queries](/flux/v0.50/guides/executing-queries)
A guide that covers the different options for executing Flux queries with InfluxDB and Chronograf v1.7+.

## [Window and aggregate data with Flux](/flux/v0.50/guides/windowing-aggregating)
This guide walks through windowing and aggregating data with Flux and demonstrates
how data is shaped in the process.

## [Group data with Flux](/flux/v0.50/guides/grouping-data)
This guide walks through grouping data in Flux with examples of how data is shaped in the process.

## [Join data with Flux](/flux/v0.50/guides/join)
This guide walks through joining data with Flux, illustrating how joined data is output and how it can be used.

## [Sort and limit data with Flux](/flux/v0.50/guides/sort-limit)
This guide walks through sorting and limiting data with Flux.

## [Optimize Flux queries](/flux/v0.50/guides/optimize-queries)
Optimize your Flux queries to reduce their memory and compute (CPU) requirements.

## [Query SQL data sources with Flux](/flux/v0.50/guides/sql)
The Flux `sql` package provides functions for working with SQL data sources.
Use `sql.from()` to query SQL databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL.

## [Regular expressions in Flux](/flux/v0.50/guides/regular-expressions)
This guide walks through using regular expressions in evaluation logic in Flux functions.

## [Use Flux in dashboards](/flux/v0.50/guides/flux-in-dashboards)
This guide walks through using Flux queries in Chronograf dashboard cells,
what template variables are available, and how to use them.

## [Create histograms with Flux](/flux/v0.50/guides/histograms)
This guide walks through using the `histogram()` function to create cumulative histograms with Flux.

## [Manipulate timestamps with Flux](/flux/v0.50/guides/manipulate-timestamps)
Use Flux to process and manipulate timestamps.

## [Query using conditional logic](/flux/v0.50/guides/conditional-logic)
This guide describes how to use Flux conditional expressions, such as `if`,
`else`, and `then`, to query and transform data.

## [Transform data with math](/flux/v0.50/guides/mathematic-operations)
This guide describes how to use Flux to transform data with mathematic operations.

## [Extract scalar values with Flux](/flux/v0.50/guides/scalar-values)
Use Flux stream and table functions to extract scalar values from Flux query output.
This lets you, for example, dynamically set variables using query results.
